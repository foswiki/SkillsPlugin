   * =%<nop>SKILLRATINGS{ ... }%= - shows a list of the skill levels, as set by %<nop>SKILLSPLUGIN_RATINGS% (see below). Parameters are:
      * =format="..."= - set the format of each skill name, where "..." is a string that may contain the following placeholders:
         * =$name= - the skill name. You can replace whitespace in the string by providing a replacement in brackets e.g =$name(&nbsp;)= will expand to the level name with all whitespace replaced by =&amp;nbsp=.
         * =$value= - the numeric value of the skill level
         * =$marker= - the selection marker
         * Standard placeholders as described in FormatTokens
      * =separator="$n"= - output list separator
      * =selection="..."= - Entry to be selected in list (integer). If one of the skills matches this selection, then =$marker= in the =format= will be expanded.
      * =marker="selected" - Text for =$marker= if the item matches =selection=
   * Example: (if plugin is enabled)
   =%<nop>SKILLRATINGS{"$name(+)=$value$marker" separator="; " selection="3" marker=" (selected)"}%= expands to %SKILLRATINGS{"$name(+)=$value$marker" separator="; " selection="3" marker=" (selected)"}%

---++ Plugin Settings

Plugin settings are stored as preferences variables in %LOCALSITEPREFS% (or in Web<nop>Preferences, or in individual topics).
   * __RECOMMENDED:__ By default, skills are taken from / added to an
     external file. You can use a standard Foswiki topic instead, by
     defining the =SKILLSPLUGIN_SKILLSTOPIC= preference to be a fully
     qualified topic name e.g.
      * =S<nop>et SKILLSPLUGIN_SKILLSTOPIC = My<nop>Web.My<nop>SkillSet=
     Normal Foswiki protections on this topic are respected. You *must*
     use a skills topic if you want skill descriptions to appear as tooltips.
   * You can override the default skill levels by setting the preference
     =SKILLSPLUGIN_RATINGS= to a comma-separated list of level names e.g.
      * =S<nop>et SKILLSPLUGIN_RATINGS = None,Child,Adolescent,Adult,Crusty=
     The default is =None,Ancient Knowledge,Working Knowledge,Expert,Guru=

%X% __IMPORTANT!__ If you used the ALLOWADDSKILLS preference with a prior
version, please note that this preference was inherently insecure and has
been removed. Define SKILLSPLUGIN_SKILLSTOPIC instead, and use standard
Foswiki permissions to control access to it.

---+++ Format of the SKILLSPLUGIN_SKILLSTOPIC
Each category is defined as a first-level heading, using ---+, subcategories
using ---++, and skills in that category as lowest level headings. You can have as many levels of headings as you need. Category and skill descriptions
should follow immediately after the relevant heading. For example:
<verbatim>
All text up to the first heading will be ignored
---+ Air Transport
Travelling in the air
---++ Flying a Helicopter
Anything with a big propellor on the top
---++ Hot Air Ballooning
Politician-powered travel
---+ Land Transport
Giving in to gravity
---++ Walking
Good for you
---++ Driving
Bad for everyone else
</verbatim>
